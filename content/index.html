title: Hello, my name is Nzia
---

<p id="index_desc">I am a final-year student that
still bothers to <a href="https://github.com/nawwab">create</a> a blog and scrolling <a href="https://twitter.com/nawwab__zia">twitter</a> instead of
trying to finish my uni life as soon as possible. 
Here, I put all of my opinions and share some experiences (mostly in indonesian) instead of just
throwing both of them straightly into the void of my head. And please 
<a

  take it with grain of salt</a>.
