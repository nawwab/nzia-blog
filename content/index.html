title: Hello, my name is Nzia
---

<p style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 32px;">I am a final-year student that still bothers to create a blog instead of
trying to finish my uni life as soon as possible.</p> 

<p>
Here, I put all of my opinions and share some experiences (mostly in indonesian) instead of just
throwing both of them straightly into the void of my head. And please 
<a

  take it with grain of salt</a>.
